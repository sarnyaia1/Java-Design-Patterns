## Java-Design-Patterns

A design pattern is a way of structuring code to solve a specific problem. A way to make the code more elegant and flexible. The code will be simpler and shorter.Design pattern does not give you any actual code to use, it’s just a guideline or template on how to solve a commonly-occuring problem. 

#Creational Design Patterns:
-	Builder Pattern (Avoid too complex or too much Constructor)
-	Singleton Pattern (Only one instance can be created)
-	Prototype Pattern (The Prototype pattern should be used when you do not want a system to know details of how objects are created.)
-	Factory Method Pattern (Used when a class doesn’t know exactly what object types need to be created)
-	Abstract Factory Pattern (Provides an interface for creating families of objects without specifying what their concrete types are)
Structural Design Patterns:
-	Adapter Pattern (European – USA connector)
-	Bridge Pattern (Simplify complex hierarchies)
-	Composite Pattern (Handle Object and groups of objects in the same way)
-	Decorator Pattern (Add additional responsibilities to an object dynamically)
-	Facade Pattern (Allow the user to perform complex processes with simple actions)
-	Flyweight Pattern (Save memory by using a single object instead of many)
-	Proxy Pattern (Put off expensive operations until they are used)




#Behavioral Design Patterns:
Behavioral design patterns are about how objects are connected and communicate with each other
-	Chain of Responsibility Pattern 
-	Command Pattern
-	Interpreter Pattern
-	Iterator Pattern
-	Mediator Pattern
-	Memento Pattern
-	Observer Pattern
-	State Pattern
-	Strategy Pattern
-	Template Pattern
-	Visitor Pattern
